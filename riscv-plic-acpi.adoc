### 5.2.12.19 RISC-V Platform Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) Structure
PLIC is used as platform global external interrupt controller for RISC-V processor. PLIC can be connected to RISC-V processor and the Harts in the processor according to the platform design. Multiple PLIC structures is possible reported in MDAT for multiple RISC-V physical processor on platform. The Privilege Modes of external interrupt is also configurable. The properties of interrupt event source and settings of PLIC should be configured by system firmware during POST according to the platform design. The settings of PLIC must be reported in MADT PLIC structure by system firmware. ACPI compliant OS can install the corresponding interrupt handler for handling Supervisor Mode external interrupts. In the case if external interrupt is triggered as Machine Mode external interrupt and the Machine Mode external interrupt is not delegated to Supervisor Mode according to ACPI SDEI table, OS will have to register event handler on Machine Mode external interrupt using Supervisor Binary Interface.
